 <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
Trello</h3>
<p>I am very happy with the code editor, 'Visual Studio' as it helps to finish off code syntax for you and allows you to download numerous libraries that help with remembering boilerplate etc</p><br/>
<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
Trello</h3>
<p>For project management I found Trello to be a good application, we utilised the assigning and comments function on certain tickets.</p>
<p></p>
 <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
<p>If I had more time, I would have spent more of it focusing on styling the webpage as a way to learn more css attributes.</p>
 <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
 <p>I would have spent more time on the border box model, played around with responsiveness as a way of learning to develop webpages for any device</p>
 <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>

much more easier, everyone always can be more officiant I could definitely make better jobe if that will be my only focus. To work with a team yes is<br>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what<br>
would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack</h3><br>
<h4>Is difficult to say what I will do next time because each project is different.<br>
Definitely to manage my productivite better there is a way of a simple system first <br>
analyze the project and split it into tasks placed on  the board<br>
and start to do that in a chronological way that can help me limit my time of work and bring<br>
better productivity. If the project is big enough it is better to bring some team member that definitely <br>
can can help as work can be split between members and take some of the stress of a single person.</h4><br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3><br>
<h4>The scope of testing. Test objectives. Budget limitations. Communication and status reporting.<br>
Industry standards. Testing measurement and metrics. Defect reporting and tracking. Configuration management.<br>
